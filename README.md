# KatoSuite Web Application

KatoSuite is a Next.js 14 application that helps educators design inclusive lesson plans, automate compliance, and prepare release-ready deployments. The repository includes a localized marketing experience, a dashboard preview, sanitized rich text rendering with DOMPurify, and a scripted deployment helper that automates the historical 11-step validator.

## ‚ú® Highlights

- **Internationalization** ‚Äì `/en` and `/fr` experiences share a common layout, locale switcher, and translation dictionaries.
- **Secure content rendering** ‚Äì User-provided copy is cleaned with DOMPurify on both server and client through a shared helper.
- **Health endpoint** ‚Äì `GET /api/health` returns `{ ok: true }` for quick uptime checks.
- **Supabase ready** ‚Äì A typed client wrapper warns when environment variables are missing.
- **Tailwind-powered UI** ‚Äì Reusable buttons, cards, and layout primitives keep the app consistent.
- **Plan-aware pricing** ‚Äì Pricing table pulls from `config/plans.json`, entitlements, and watermark policy helpers.
- **Smoke test coverage** ‚Äì Vitest exercises the sanitizer and ensures malicious markup is removed.
- **Deployment helper** ‚Äì `deploy-to-github-vercel.sh` mirrors the 11-step validation workflow before suggesting the `git push` command.

## üîê Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in values before integrating with live services:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`
- `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
- `PINTEREST_CONVERSION_TOKEN`

Keep secrets outside of version control and mirror production values in Vercel settings before each release.

## üì¶ Deployment Helper

The helper mirrors the historical codex deployment workflow and concludes with the full Vercel playbook:

```bash
chmod +x deploy-to-github-vercel.sh && ./deploy-to-github-vercel.sh "feat: KatoSuite production launch"
```

It validates tooling, summarizes repository changes, prints the `git push codex HEAD` command, and reiterates the post-push Vercel rollout steps. After pushing, deploy with `vercel --prod` and complete the smoke tests in `FINAL_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md`.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security & QA

- Sanitization lives in [`lib/sanitize-html.ts`](./lib/sanitize-html.ts) and is covered by [`tests/sanitize-html.test.ts`](./tests/sanitize-html.test.ts).
- Locale dictionaries are enforced through the `TranslationProvider`, ensuring text is available for each supported language.
- The deployment helper refuses to push without confirmation so you can review warnings before launch.
